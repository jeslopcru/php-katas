# Isogram

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

Determine if a word or sentence is an isogram.
An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter.

Examples of isograms:

- lumberjacks
- background
- downstream

The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.
